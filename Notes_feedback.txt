Great job, Jonas!

My comments:
Story:
Your visualization nicely depicts the differences between rather service-oriented Malaysia and rather agricultural Indonesia. As a reader, I was able to complete the whole picture. In my opinion, the finding in the data is obvious and clearly communicated. The only detail I would point out is to add context to the graphs in the bottom (DeathRate, FDI, Unemployment), I didn't understand what for example Unemployment value of 6 means. Maybe as a bullet list with short description and value explanation

Design:
Chart types and colors are appropriate and helped me get oriented in the story. The animation (switch between the two countries) makes it a little difficult to hover over a specific point to see the corresponding value (e.g. EmployAgriculture value in Malaysia in 1990). Slower animation may be a better choice (up to you to experiment and decide). Lastly, the Y-Axis lable of the GDP Graph wouldn't make sense without context, I suggest switch the axis label to "GDP" instead of "number".

Anyway, your visualization is very nice! Good luck with your project review
